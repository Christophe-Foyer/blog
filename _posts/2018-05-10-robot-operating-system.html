<h5>My debut in ROS</h5>

<p>For the longest time I've been meaning to learn ROS. It seems like a much more modular way of coding a robot and allows for developers to collaborate in a much 
more efficient way. This interest was rekindled by my current internship (which is also one of the reasons posts have been less frequent) through which I really
started to feel much more confident as a software developer. So here I am with a picture of a simple turtlebot sim running on an Ubuntu virtual machine

<h5>More to come on this, hopefully with some actual hardware once I get back home to my trusty CR-10. Hoping to build some outdoor projects and possibly even
some in aquatic environments, but I'll leave the details on that for later.</h5>
