<h5>A short blog post about what's next</h5>

<p>I put in my notice a month ago, 2 months notice was too much for a job I didn't care for. Just three weeks to go. Trying to do my best to leave on good terms (coworkers are good people too, don't want to let them down).</p>
<p>I'll be applying to masters for next year, still have to decide whether I should got for the WUSTL MSME but likely a no.<br>
Going to see if I can stay in the UK for the time being, otherwise, off to the US or Australia to work (visa just cleared, still have to see if jobs I care for exist there).<br>
Also going to take some time off in the meantime to maybe do some online coursework, work on projects, and generally enjoy the summer around London
and europe now that I'll be saving myself 8 hours of commute and have a much more flexible schedule.</p>

<p>We'll see what's next, and I wish my current coworkers all the best, things are looking up for them, hopefully they are for me too</p>
