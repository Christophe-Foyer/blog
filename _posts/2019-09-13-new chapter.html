<h5>News about my whereabouts, my summer, my current trajectory.</h5>

<p>
A lot has changed in the past few months, going from being employed with what was arguably the wrong role, to willfully unemployed with no concrete plans 
apart from a vague "maybe a masters, probably move to a new country" to now being admitted to a university I thought I had no chance of getting into.
It's been a wild ride between all the worrying, being glad, and good dose of self-doubt, but I guess sometimes things work out for the best.
</p>

<p>
This summer has been very positive for me, letting me explore what I'm genuinely interested in, work on developing skills, fix old habits and develop new ones.
It's been great exploring London, getting used to going to events, which is something I never really had the opportunity to do outside of a university setting 
due to my previous locations. I've exercised excessively, to the point of worrying about me knees, and for some reason went back for more, trading a few 
kilometers per day running for Salsa and climbing.
<p>

<p>
This summer has been exciting, boring, amazing, and disappointing, and while right now it's hard to not worry about moving on from my current lifestyle,  
but I'm also convinced that it's the start of a new adventure. We'll see what the future has in store.
</p>

<p>
Until next time,
</p>
