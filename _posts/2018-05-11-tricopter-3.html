<h5>A short Picture update of my progress so far</h5>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="/2018/03/18/tricopter-2.html">this post</a> about a month ago</p>

<p>As you may know I'm currently in the Netherlands working on a project for Tata Steel Europe 
so I've had a lot less free time to work on these projects on the side (it also doesn't help that I'm away from my workshop, so no hardware stuff for now).
However, that doesn't mean I'm out of new things to talk about, and so I thought it'd be good to post an update on the state of my tricopter project.</p>

<p>A nose cone for mounting the FPV camera</p>

<p>No hotglue so here comes out the electrical tape secured with hotglue (a proven method in my experience)</p>

<p>Empty fuselage, it won't survive its first flight but it looks good.<br>
Side-note: Props are on to check sizing, always make sure props are off before you connect any of the ESCs to power!</p>

<p>Things are looking a bit nicer (including the workbench).</p>

<p>Charging the battery with my brand new IMAX B6. 
Amazing thing for the price, I would 100% recommend it if you ever need to charge lipos and need a nice starter charger</p>

<p>Ready to go! As you can see the nosecone isn't on yet. 
I had issues with it being too small to easily access the hex bolts so I'm redesigning it with access holes and slightly bigger.
That's one of the great advantages of 3D printers, very fast turnaround time for prototyping.<br>
Anyways I'll post pictures and videos of it flying when I get back from the Netherlands in July.
I'm changing out the KK2 board for a F3 boaqrd running cleanflight (one one of the variants). 
That should give me much better control over settings and better performance and I'm really looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the update and I look forward to posting videos of the first few test flights once I get results I'm satisfied with.

Ciao,
