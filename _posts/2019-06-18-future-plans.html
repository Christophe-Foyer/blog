<h5>A short blog post about what's next. (Reuploaded 13-sep-2019)</h5>	

<p>
A quick note (13/09/2019):
<i><br>
I removed this a few months ago because it felt like I had made a foolish decision taking a leap of faith like I had.
I had no concrete plans for what next, I applied to a total of 2 schools, one of which I applied to 2 weeks after this post, and got rejected the next day due to it having filled up.
The plan was now to wait to hear back from UCL before some vague plans to either find a job in the US, or move to Australia on a temporary visa I had just been awarded after applying in January.
I just want to keep this accessible for documentations and for reference later down the road. Short post, but I think it says a lot.
</i></p>

<p>I put in my notice a month ago, 2 months notice was too much for a job I didn't care for. Just three weeks to go. Trying to do my best to leave on good terms (coworkers are good people too, don't want to let them down).</p>	
<p>I'll be applying to masters for next year, still have to decide whether I should go for the WUSTL MSME but likely a no.<br>	
Going to see if I can stay in the UK for the time being, otherwise, off to the US or Australia to work (visa just cleared, still have to see if jobs I care for exist there).<br>	
Also going to take some time off in the meantime to maybe do some online coursework, work on projects, and generally enjoy the summer around London	
and europe now that I'll be saving myself 8 hours of commute and have a much more flexible schedule.</p>	

<p>We'll see what's next, and I wish my current coworkers all the best, things are looking up for them, hopefully they are for me too</p>
