<p>3D-printed wind turbine, (Work In Progress)

<p>I'm currently in the process of rebuilding an old wind turbine project I started back in high-school now that I actually know what I'm doing (for the most part)</p>

<p>This is very much a work in progress but I'll make sure to update this page once I make more progress on this build</p>

<p>So far I've managed to make pretty good bearing blocks and a decent parametrically designed hub that should accommodate for hooking this up onto a (very) small generator.
I still need to design the gearbox if I want to use the single phase synchoneous AC motor but this does create a whole other bunch of issues that might just be too time 
consuming for me to address at this time. Otherwise I also dismantled an old drill, and while it's not designed to be back-driven, the drill chuck does provide a decent gear 
ration which might just do. More on this later</p>

<p>In the meantime, here's a short gif of it spinning</p>
