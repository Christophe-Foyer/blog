New way of hosting updates using JekLog hosted on Github!

I will slowly be migrating all my content to here which is a more reliable hosting method than self-hosting (not to mention faster). Side-projects such as my robot control page or other services will likely still be self-hosted because of the customizability self-hosting allows me to have.  
  
I hope you enjoy the new website.
