<h5>My first attempt at making a folding tricopter using 3D printed parts</h5>

<p>A couple weeks ago I got myself my first personal 3D-printer (great mid-range printer, the CR-10 is extremely reliable for the price)
and one of the first few projects I decided to undertake using this new tool at my disposition</p>

<p>Many of the parts printed were designed by Michael Erwin (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:486465">link to the files</a>)
with a few custom parts that I will likely post on thingiverse in just a bit.</p>

<p>The main reason I decided to go with a Tricopter build was to repurpose the parts I bought for building a quadcopter.<br>
First of all, a Tricopter is easier to design for folding, and I'm hoping to redesign the midframe to match my electronics better
once I get it flying (currently waiting on propellers, the current ones aren't giving me enough thrust and the motors have some leftover
power for larger propellers).<br>
The other reason is that when buying parts for my quadcopter back in 2014, I didn't think to buy motors with CCW threads, only CW, which means that
two of my motor nuts will tend to unscrew when spinning. This could be mitigated with a bit of locktite but that's not ideal. This issue
doesn't necessarily arise in tricopters because yaw control doesn't depend on having two pairs of counter-rotating motors varying power, a
tricopter instead uses a servo on the tail rotor to vary the angle of the motor axis, which means all motors can rotate in the same direction
without losing yaw authority.</p>

<h4>Printing the parts</h4>

<p>The CR-10 is a really amazing machine for the price. This must have been my 3rd print at that point if you don't count the ones where I tried printing directly
on the glass without any kind of adhesive (immediately causing the print to unstick from the build surface), and these parts printed extremely well.
This set of parts weighs in at around 100 grams (if I remember correctly) and took around 11 hours to print at 80mm/s speed setting in Cura</p>

<h4>Yaw actuation assembly</h4>

<p>I used an old, cheap $2 servo for yaw with some piano wire attached to two screws. I didn't have any of those hex-lock contraptions which would have made it easier
to tweak in the future but this seems to work ok for now. My only concern is the plastic gears on the servo which may break if I crash. I might need to upgrade it to a nicer servo.

<h4>Redrilling the holes</h4>

<p>Hole features tend to be underdimensionned on FDM printers. You can either take that into account in software or simply accept that the
holes will be too small and re-drill the holes once the part is done printing which is a reliable method of getting perfectly sized holes</p>

<h5>More to come. This is an ongoing project. There's a few more pictures I have of my custom designed parts I already have but I'd like to put them somewhere
on thingiverse for example before I post pictures so it's easy to find the source files.</h5>
