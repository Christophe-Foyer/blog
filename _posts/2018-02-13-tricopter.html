title: 3D-printed Folding Tricopter
slug: tricopter
---

<p>This is my first at making a folding tricopter using 3D printed parts</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I got myself my first personal 3D-printer (great mid-range printer, the CR-10 is extremely reliable for the price)
and one of the first few projects I decided to undertake using this new tool at my disposition</p>

<p>Many of the parts printed were designed by Michael Erwin (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:486465">link to the files</a> 
with a few custom parts that I will likely post on thingiverse in just a bit.</p>

<p>The main reason I decided to go with a Tricopter build was to repurpose the parts I bought for building a quadcopter.<br>
First of all, a Tricopter is easier to design for folding, and I'm hoping to redesign the midframe to match my electronics better
once I get it flying (currently waiting on propellers, the current ones aren't giving me enough thrust and the motors have some leftover
power for larger propellers).<br>
The other reason is that when buying parts for my quadcopter back in 2014, I didn't think to buy motors with CCW threads, only CW, which means that
two of my motor nuts will tend to unscrew when spinning. This could be mitigated with a bit of locktite but that's not ideal. This issue
doesn't happen on tricopters because yaw control doesn't depend on having two pairs of counter-rotating motors varying power, but a
tricopter instead uses a servo on the tail rotor to vary the angle of the motor axis, which means all motors can rotate in the same direction
without losing yaw control.</p>

<h4>Redrilling the holes</h4>

<p>Hole features tend to be underdimensionned on FDM printers. You can either take that into account in software or simply design the
holes to be too small and re-drill the holes one the part is done printing which is usually a more reliable method of getting perfectly
sized holes</p>
