<h5>Tricopter Redesign and ideas moving on.</h5>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="http://www.cfoyer.com/blog/2018/02/13/tricopter.html">this post</a> a few weeks ago</p>

<p>Since my last post I've redesigned the entire midframe, adding a camera mount and removable battery compartment and making it easier to store electronics inside the frame
which is a big plus in rainy weather (which we get a lot of in Normandy, where I am right now)</p>

<h4>Rendering of the current assembly.</h4>

<p>I'm still using the motor mounts and feet from the thingiverse page files that I used last time, but I hope to replace those soon as they stick out more than
I would like, and using piano wire to attach the back motor gimbal seems somewhat redundant when I could be driving it directly<p>
