<p>My experiments with 3-wheeled electric longboards and the current state of this project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/3-wheeled-electric-longboard/18919">Link</a> to the thread on www.electric-skateboard.builders.</p>

<h4>Initial Design Concept</h4>

<p>The initial design concept for the 3-wheeled longboard.<br>
I wanted to keep this cheap and therefore decided to modify an off-the-shelf board rather than design my own, though that may be necessary in the future for stability reasons when riding.
The design features a single back wheel which allows the motor to be attached directly to the board, which I hoped would give the board a lower profile and overall be simpler mechanically.</p>

<h4>Fiberglass enclosure</h4>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have pictures of the fiberglass layup, but I will say that it was a bit messy (epoxy is very sticky, which is usually a good thing but not on my hands). This is the enclosure getting ready to be spray-painted.
The enclosure is just 2 layers of fiberglass layed up on to of a foam mold with the rough dimensions of my battery pack plus extra room for miscelaneous electronics</p>

<h4>Spay-painted</h4>

<p>Just used some black rustoleum paint. Seems to adhere pretty well to the surface. The fiberglass was not vacuum bagged so maybe the rough surface helped</p>

<h4>Water Seal</h4>

<p>This is far from being the best water seal out there, but since the goal was just water resistance (I'm not planning on taking this for a ride through deep puddles or underwater and time soon)
I just used some leftover weathering strips I had laying around. A bit of silicon caulk for the corners and it seems to be holding up quite well.</p>

<h4>Attached with M4 Hex bolts</h4>

<p>Corners held down with hex bolts for now. I put M4 wood inserts in the board and it looks very clean even if the enclosure is removed.</p>

<h4>Enclosure on</h4>

<p>What the bottom of the board looks like with the enclosure on.</p>

<h4>Adding some reinforcements</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l8Y257M.jpg" style="width:100%">
<p>Added a few balsa strips and a third layer of fiberglass on the inside (because the inside wasn't painted it'll adhere better there)
and this gives the enclosure a king of corrugated layer of fiberglass on the inside which helps a lot with rigidity widthwise. Looks pretty cool too.</p>

<h4>Back wheel assembly</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DCGFwj9.jpg" style="width:100%">
<p>Missing a nut, but the timing pulley was machined down to size and holes were cut at the wanted locations (they had to be very precise as this is what keeps the pulley centered).</p>

<h4>Battery pack and BMS installed</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHi4hbN.jpg" style="width:100%">
<p>I have a few more pictures of building that laying around somewhere. I'll add them eventually. This was by far the tedious part of the build. I needed each cell to be individually removable to comply to the TSA's under 100Wh each and non-modified battery rules
so I mounted every single one of those cells in 18650 holders with 10AWG wire wiring them up in a 10S4P pack. This gives me 37V nominal voltage (each cell is 3.7V nominal, and there are 10 in series 4 in parallel for a total of 40 cells).
This amounts to 370Wh total or around 26 miles (~42km) of range using the 14Wh/mile rule of thumb. They all conveniently charge from a single charger thanks to the BMS (Battery Management System) and a 42V 2A charger that should charge it from empty to full in about 5 hours.</p>

<h4>The motor!</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Qpmij6.jpg" style="width:100%">
<p>This is one of my favorite parts of the board. It is very satisfyingly heavy weighing in at 1200 grams and can output up to 2750 watts of power at max voltage. It's currently mounted on a 3D printed mount that I was hoping to use on the board
but will only use as a test stand because of slight design modifications that will make it easier to tighten the belt.</p>

<h4>A vague idea of how it will come together.</h4>

<h4>New motor mount</h4>

<p>Decided the 3-wheeled design would need some refinement before being usable. Luckily this was something I anticipated from the start and I knew that it would be easy to swap out the back wheel for a more conventional 4-wheel design.
So that is what I did. Inspired by products sold online I designed this mount to put on my longboard trucks.</p>

<h4>Plywood frame for the enclosure</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/10Zzxm1.jpg" style="width:100%">
<p>Now that a lot of the main issues had been resolved. I thought it would be nice to make sure the entire enclosure would be flush against the board so I added some plywood strips to make the flanges more rigid.
I also swapped out the wooded inserts for steel ones as the threads on the brass ones kept breaking when putting in bolts.</p>

<h4>Waiting for the belt</h4>

<p>Everything is now working. Just waiting for the belt.</p>

<h4>Printing risers and the transmitter case</h4>

<h4>The finished board</h4>

<p>Finally done! At least for now, I do want to revisit the 3-wheeled design in the future but since I want something functional before all else this will have to do.</p>
<p>I have a few more pictures I will be posting showing individual parts and a few of the issues I encountered (and maybe even a video of it being ridden) but for now I think this is a good overview of this project.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've added a few pictures to the final album including a short video of a cousin riding the finished board<p>
